The Adagio Project attempts to be a modern, open source server control panel
built on top of Symfony, and a set of components to manage systems.

## Status

This project is a complete work in progress, proof of concept. The initial 
goal is to craft well designed libraries as they are requred for each feature
added to the panel, from a simple login to configuring a web server.
